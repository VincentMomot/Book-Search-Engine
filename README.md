# Book Search Engine
A restful API converted to a GraphQL book search engine


### Website Features:
1) A converted book search engine
2) Login functionality
3) Saved books are readily viewable
4) Search books by titles

### What I learned from the creation of this site:
* Using GraphQL to create a search engine
* Using MongoDB to connect to Heroku
* Setting up the MongoDB for any IP address visitors
